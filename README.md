### Sqaure

- Tried out a square with rounded edges 
- First 3 numbers are normal, x, y, size and the last number/s are the corners radius - (only one number, all edges will be the same)


### setTimeout

setTimeout ( makeSquare, 2000)    —- time in milliseconds ( 2000 = 2 seconds)
Not in draw


    function mousePressed() whenever mouse is pressed  {this will happen}

- Can use random numbers in x, y, and colour/fill so the object appears as a different colour and position each time.

- Can put setTimeout into the original function so it calls itself.
- 
### setInterval

  setInterval (make “this” , 1000)
Every one second “this” will happen

- Put “random” in original function → (in fill and x and y Pos)
- clearInterval → stops interval
